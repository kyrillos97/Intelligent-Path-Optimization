# Intelligent-Path-Optimization

 **This project focuses on comparing the performance of three metaheuristic optimization algorithms for solving the pathfinding problem in a grid-based environment. The algorithms implemented are:**

1. **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: Mimics the foraging behavior of ants, using pheromone trails to guide the search for optimal paths.
2. **Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)**: Inspired by the intelligent foraging behavior of honeybees, utilizing scout bees to explore potential solutions and employed bees to exploit promising areas.
2. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: Inspired by the social behavior of bird flocks or fish schools, where particles (solutions) move through the solution space by following the best solutions found by themselves and their neighbors.
